I'm a software engineer living in Austin, TX. In addition to making useless
websites, I've also established international fame by:

* Marrying Bethany Kessen
* Making sensational homemade beef jerky
* Become the unofficial face of bacon on facebook

I'm known on the internet at places like `Launchpad`_ and IRC as "doanac".

Work
----
Overall I'm pretty passionate about Linux and have been lucky enough to have
spent the past 7 years working on embedded Linux. In 2011, I was hired by
`Canonical`_ to work for the non-profit consortium `Linaro`_ to focus on
helping Linux on ARM. In 2013, I took a job in Canonical leading a team
focused on developing QA tools.

I created the first Android Ski Report application that was merged into
WakeMeSki in 2010. I still spend a fair amount of free time doing work on this:

* `Source Code`_
* `Android Market`_
